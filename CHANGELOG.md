## 0.2.0

BREAKING CHANGES:

* deployer_role now requires an undeploy_sfn_arn input.
* slack_notifier now requires an undeploy_sfn input.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Undeploy. Invoking the Undeploy state machine with a service name and account name will destroy _production_ assets of that service in the given account. Because this is potentially dangerous, undeploy requires a service deployment to opt in to undeployment by setting DeployConfig.AllowUndeploy to true on deployment, or by being deployed into an account whose environment is not "production". If DeployConfig.AllowUndeploy is explicitly set to false, services deployed in an account whose environment is not "production" also cannot be undeployed.
* Automatic Undeployment. Any service that can be undeployed can be deployed with DeployConfig.AutomaticUndeployMinutes set. Deployomat will automatically undeploy the service the specified number of minutes after a successful deploy with such a configuration.
* Nicely error out on deploy if the template ASG cannot be identified.
* Provide known errors to the Slack Notifer, which it now provides when a deployment fails for a known resason.

## 0.1.2

BUG FIXES:

* Fixed Config retrieving organization prefix from account prefix.

## 0.1.1

BUG FIXES:

* Fixed typo in Config#deploy_role_arn

## 0.1.0

BREAKING CHANGES:

ENHANCEMENTS:

* If SkipNotifications is true, still notify for failed deployments.

## 0.0.8

BUG FIXES:

* When cancelling a deploy, if listener_arns are configured but no rules are found, complete the cancel.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* If the deployment configuration includes a truthy SkipNotifications input, slack notifier will not ping slack.

## 0.0.7

BUG FIXES:

* If the production auto scaling group is temporarily above its max instance count, clamp instance count for preventing scale in to the configured max instance count.

## 0.0.6

BUG FIXES:

* Don't have syntax errors.

## 0.0.5

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Support AWS Provider 4.x.

## 0.0.3

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Support "rollback" of an intial deployment. This will reset to as clean a state as possible.

KNOWN ISSUES:

* If deployment of a web service encounters an error when cloning the template autoscaling group the cloned target groups will not be deleted by the rollback.

## 0.0.2

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Make deployer role name configurable.
* Allow zero sized auto scaling groups.

## 0.0.1
